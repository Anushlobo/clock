# Digital Clock Project 🕒

This is a simple **Digital Clock** web project made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It displays the current time in **HH : MM : SS** format and updates every second.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for the basic structure
- **CSS3** – for stylish background and layout
- **JavaScript** – to fetch real-time clock data using `Date()` and `setInterval`

## 💡 Features

- Real-time clock display (updates every second)
- Leading zeros for single-digit values (e.g., 09:04:05)
- Glassmorphism design using `backdrop-filter: blur()`
- Responsive and centered layout
- Decorative gradient background with floating shapes

## 📂 File Structure
